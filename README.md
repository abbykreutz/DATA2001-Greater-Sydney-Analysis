# DATA2001-Greater-Sydney-Analysis
DATA2001 final group project for which my partner and I received High Distinction (HD).

Calculated a “bustling” score of the Greater Sydney Area's Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) regions by integrating diverse public datasets on businesses, transit stops, polling locations, school catchments, energy use, homelessness, and geospatial shapefiles to visualize results with interactive maps.
